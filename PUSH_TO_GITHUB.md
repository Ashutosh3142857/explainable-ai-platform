# Push Enhanced Platform to GitHub

## Current Status
✅ **All Captum and Circuit Tracing features are FULLY IMPLEMENTED**  
✅ **Platform enhanced with 5 analysis modes**  
✅ **Code ready for deployment**

## What You Have Now
Your enhanced LLM interpretability platform includes:

### New Features Added:
1. **Captum PyTorch Interpretability**
   - Integrated Gradients attribution
   - Gradient SHAP analysis  
   - Saliency mapping visualization
   - Multi-method comparison with correlation analysis

2. **Anthropic Circuit Tracing**
   - Neural pathway visualization with interactive network graphs
   - Circuit complexity analysis and pathway strength measurement
   - Behavior-specific circuit identification (factual recall, reasoning, syntax)
   - Activation patching and causal tracing

3. **Enhanced UI with 5 Analysis Modes**
   - Standard Neural Pathway Analysis
   - Advanced Multi-Head Attention  
   - Comparison Mode
   - **Captum Analysis** (NEW)
   - **Circuit Tracing** (NEW)

## Command to Push
```bash
git push https://ghp_8Rt6qlfW5W422B4svOqCbtDXKJ8vy90ejbin@github.com/Ashutosh3142857/explainable-ai-platform.git main --force
```

**Note**: Make sure there's a SPACE before `--force`

## If Git Corruption Persists
1. Clone fresh repository: `git clone https://github.com/Ashutosh3142857/explainable-ai-platform.git fresh_repo`
2. Copy enhanced files from this workspace to fresh_repo
3. Commit and push from clean repository

## Files Ready for Deployment
- `app.py` - Main application with all 5 analysis modes
- `utils/captum_analyzer.py` - Complete Captum integration
- `utils/anthropic_circuit_tracer.py` - Circuit tracing functionality
- `utils/dual_mode_analyzer.py` - Enhanced dual-mode analysis
- `replit.md` - Updated comprehensive documentation
- All supporting visualization and UI files

Your platform is now a comprehensive LLM interpretability solution with cutting-edge analysis capabilities.
